Hackathon Problem Statement: Rider
Telemetry Challenge 
Overview 
Participants must build a wearable telemetry system that attaches to a rider’s helmet, jacket,
and/or pants and captures real-time motion and location data. The system must display live
information on a mobile app and store all readings with timestamps. 
The app should also detect whether the rider is on a scooter, a motorcycle, or not riding, based
on posture and motion. All prototypes must be fully demonstrable on the test track during the
hackathon. 
 
Data to Capture (Minimum Requirement) 
Teams may use any number of sensors of their choosing, but their system must at least
measure and record the following: 
● Acceleration (3-axis): Detect motion, braking, lean, and body orientation.
● Deceleration (derived from acceleration): Detect stops or harsh braking.
● Speed: From GPS or IMU integration; used to validate ride segments.
● GPS Position (latitude, longitude, timestamp): For track matching, ride path, and
scoring.
● Timestamped Data Storage (mandatory): All sensor data and GPS points must be
stored locally on the mobile app for evaluation.
 
 
 
 
 
Test Procedure 
Each prototype will be tested using the following sequence: 
Start → Walk → Bike/Scooter → Walk → Scooter/Bike → Walk → End 
● The helmet, jacket, and pants used for the test will be displayed before the hackathon
begins. 
● Teams must design their mounts using only these items.
● The preset track will be shared with all teams in advance.
● Prototypes must function through the entire test without losing data, power, or
attachment.
 
 
Evaluation Criteria 
Category 
Description 
Sensor Stability 
Sensors stay attached and functional throughout the entire test. 
Mounting Quality 
Secure attachment that leaves no stains, marks, or residue on the
displayed gear. 
GPS Data Volume More GPS points captured results in a higher score. 
GPS Accuracy 
Lower average deviation from the reference track results in a higher
score. 
Vehicle Type
Detection
Correct identification of scooter, motorcycle, or walking. 
Bill of Materials(BoM) Lower hardware cost results in a higher score. 
System Weight 
Lighter assembly results in a higher score. 
Battery Endurance Must last for both rides and the idle time between. 
App UX/UI 
Clear, intuitive display of live data and map. 
Data Storage 
All data (sensor and GPS) must be stored locally with timestamps
for verification. 
Demonstratability Prototype must perform live during the test without post-processing
or external tools. 
Innovation Challenge Most creative idea built on top of the core requirements that can be
demonstrated live. 
 
Innovation Challenge 
Teams are encouraged to go beyond the mandatory requirements and add an innovative feature
that enhances rider experience, safety, data analysis, or usability, as long as it can be
demonstrated live during the final test. 
Examples include, but are not limited to: 
● Additional insights derived from motion or GPS data.
● Visual, audio, or haptic feedback to the rider.
● Smart data visualization, gamification, or scoring mechanisms.
● Compact or modular mounting designs.
● Energy optimization or intelligent sensor activation logic.
 
Innovation will be judged on: 
● Originality: Novel or unique idea or approach.
● Relevance: Builds meaningfully on the base system.
● Demonstrability: Clearly shown during the test or demo session. 
 
Constraints and Expectations 
● Only the displayed helmet, jacket, and pants may be used for mounting sensors.
● All mounts must be non-permanent and leave no stains or damage.
● The system must run on a single battery charge for both rides.
● All data must remain local to the app (no cloud upload).
● The setup must be safe, compact, and easily removable.
 
 
 
End Goal 
By the end of the hackathon, each team must demonstrate: 
1. A working prototype attached to the provided riding gear.
2. A live app display on the app showing:
○ Real-time acceleration, deceleration, speed, and GPS map.
○ Correctly detected riding state (scooter, motorcycle, walking).
3. A stored data log in the app containing all readings with timestamps.
4. A brief explanation of the design, cost, accuracy, and any innovative feature
implemented.
